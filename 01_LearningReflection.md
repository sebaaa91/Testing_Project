## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was interesting since I haven't done anything like this before. I was also a little bit stressed about it but it went well in the end. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I wrote everything in Word because I didn't know where I should write it and that felt the most natural place to write it. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Google and Youtube are good places to look for help, but I only used the provided materials.     


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I have used Visual Studio Code. 


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Everything went well. 


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn't have any trouble using Github, since I have used it before on other courses. 
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Robot Framework because it uses human-readable and keyword driven syntax. 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- By searching "tester" I found many jobs. They were searching people with testing skills, coding skilss, quality assurance and game development. 
- I didn't find any jobs in Linkedin with the keyboard "automation tester". 



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Coding skills, more knowledge about automation testing and quality assurance.

(is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think the project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice, since I've never done anything like this and now I could see real examples how it is done. I think everything about the course went well.
